# Bank Account Management System

This project demonstrates my expertise in data structures and algorithms by implementing a robust Bank Account Management System. It utilizes advanced hashing techniques including Chaining, Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic Probing for efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring optimal performance even with large datasets. Everything implemented here was totally from scratch, without the usage of Standard C++ Libraries.

## Technical Details

- **Implemented Techniques:** Utilized Chaining for collision resolution, while Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic Probing were employed for handling collisions and ensuring data integrity.
- **Custom Collision Resolution:** Implemented custom strategies to efficiently manage collisions and maintain organized data storage.
- **Language and Submission:** Developed in C++ according to the guidelines of the COL106: Data Structures and Algorithms course, Semester-I 2023â€“2024 at IIT Delhi.
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Evaluated based on correctness, efficiency, memory management, and robust handling of corner cases. Emphasis was placed on the efficiency of custom hashing strategies in real-world scenarios.
